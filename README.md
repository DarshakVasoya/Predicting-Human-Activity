# Predicting-Human-Activity
<p>We will be using the Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones database, which was built from the recordings of study participants who carried a smartphone with an embedded inertial sensor while performing activities of daily living (ADL). The objective is to classify the activities the participants performed into one of the six following categories: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

The following information is provided for each record in the dataset:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables
The activity label</p>
